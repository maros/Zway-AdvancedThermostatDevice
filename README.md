# Zway-AdvancedThermostatDevice

This module combines an actor and a temperature sensor to form a thermostat.
The actor will be turned on off depending on the temperature measured and a
set-point defined by either a virtual thermostat provided in the config
or alternatively created by this module.

# Configuration

## thermostat

Thermostat device for setpoints. If no device is provided, a virtual
thermostat will be created.

## switch

Thermostat switch to enable/disable operation. If no device is provided, a
virtual switch will be created.

## temperatureSensors

Multiple temperature sensors. The measurements will be weighted based on
the last update timestamp.

## windowSensors

Multiple binary sensors (such as window sensors) that temporarily disable
thermostat operation.

## mode

Operation mode: Heat or cool

## hysteresis

Maximal delta between current and target temperature after which thermostat
should turn on/off

## unitTemperature

Temperature Unit: Metric or imperial

## maxTime, pauseTime

Optional setting (in minutes) for maximum operation time and pauses between
operation. If maximum operaton time was reached the switch will be turned off,
regardless of the current temperature. Furthermore the switch will not be tuned
on again before the minimum pause time has elapsed.

## maxTemperature, minTemperature

Maximun and minimum temperature for thermostat widget.

# Events

No events are emitted

# Virtual Devices

Up to two virtual devices are created.

# Installation

Make sure that the BaseModule is installed prior to installing this module
( https://github.com/maros/Zway-BaseModule )

The prefered way of installing this module is via the "Zwave.me App Store"
available in 2.2.0 and higher. For stable module releases no access token is
required. If you want to test the latest pre-releases use 'k1_beta' as
app store access token.

For developers and users of older Zway versions installation via git is
recommended.

```shell
cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules
git clone https://github.com/maros/Zway-AdvancedThermostatDevice.git AdvancedThermostatDevice --branch latest
```

To update or install a specific version
```shell
cd /opt/z-way-server/automation/userModules/AdvancedThermostatDevice
git fetch --tags
# For latest released version
git checkout tags/latest
# For a specific version
git checkout tags/1.02
# For development version
git checkout -b master --track origin/master
```
